TOF050F Modbus Interface

This repository contains a Python script designed for interfacing with a TOF050F Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging sensor via the Modbus protocol. The script facilitates communication and data retrieval from the TOF050F sensor, leveraging the Modbus RTU protocol for efficient transmission of information.

The implementation was tailored for use with a Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5). It establishes a direct connection between the sensor and the Raspberry Pi. The TX (transmit) and RX (receive) leads of the TOF050F sensor are connected to the GPIO 14 and GPIO 15 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) pins on the Raspberry Pi 5, respectively. Additionally, the VIN (voltage input) is connected to a 3V pin.

This script serves as a foundational tool for developers and engineers looking to integrate the TOF050F sensor into their projects, offering a straightforward approach to harnessing the capabilities of time-of-flight ranging via the Modbus protocol on a Raspberry Pi platform.
